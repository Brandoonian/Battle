Battle is a project that aims to replicate a popular turn-based game.
We will start in the simplest form, with no graphics using pygame.
Once completed in this form, we will upgrade to a more complete and interactive version.
Also, we will be starting with only three monsters with hopes of 
expanding that number once a version of the game has been completed in 
pygame. Here, I will lay out the steps in my plan to creating the game in it's first
and simplest form.

Step 1: Create main file which will greet the player, let them choose their monster,
and run the game. 

Step 2: Create classes for each monster assigning them characteristics such as HP and attacks
that will make the game fun and interesting.

Step 3: Create a function to assign the cpu a monster at random.

Step 4: Create a function that allows cpu to control monster in a way that
makes the game fun and interesting.

Step 5: Create a loop that will simulate a battle between the player and cpu
letting the player give the monster commands.

Step 6: Exit loop once battle is over and explain the results.

Step 7: Ask player if they would like to play again.
